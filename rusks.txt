Rusks

(My mixer is too small to make this in one batch, so I split the recipe in two and mix two separate batches)

1 kg (2.2lb) Self raising flour
2 tsp salt
2 tsp baking powder
500 ml (16.9 fl oz)muesli
250 ml (8.5 fl oz) sunflower seeds
250 ml (8.5 fl oz)chopped roasted almonds
125 ml (4.2 fl oz) desiccated coconut
2/3 cup of seedless raisins
500 ml (16.9 fl oz) Allbran flakes
500 ml (16.9 fl oz) brown sugar
2 extra-large eggs
500 g (1.1 lb) butter, melted
500 ml (16.9 fl oz) buttermilk

Preheat oven to 180 degrees C (356 degrees F) and prepare 4 small bread pans.
Mix the dry ingredients, including the brown sugar, together.
Whisk the eggs and add the butter and buttermilk and mix well.
Add the egg mixture to the dry ingredients and mix well.
Divide mixture between 4 bread pans and bake for 45-60 minutes.
Let cool for 10 minutes and remove from pans.
Let cool further (the cooler the easier it is to cut) and cut into pieces with a sharp bread knife.
Put in oven at 100 degrees C (212 degrees F) for approx. 3 to 4 hrs to dry out.
